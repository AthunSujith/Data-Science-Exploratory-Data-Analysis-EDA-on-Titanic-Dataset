## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset contains demographic and passenger information for Titanic passengers:

| Column       | Description                         |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| PassengerId  | Unique ID for each passenger        |
| Survived     | Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)          |
| Pclass       | Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) |
| Name         | Passenger name                      |
| Sex          | Gender                              |
| Age          | Age in years                        |
| SibSp        | # of siblings/spouses aboard        |
| Parch        | # of parents/children aboard        |
| Ticket       | Ticket number                       |
| Fare         | Passenger fare                      |
| Cabin        | Cabin number                        |
| Embarked     | Port of Embarkation (C, Q, S)       |

## üß† Features Created

- **Title Extraction**: Extracted titles (Mr, Miss, etc.) from the `Name` column.
- **FamilySize**: Combined `SibSp` + `Parch` + 1.
- **IsAlone**: Binary feature to indicate if passenger is alone.
- **FareBins & AgeBins**: Discretized versions of `Fare` and `Age`.

## üìà Visualizations Used

- Correlation heatmap
- Fare vs. Survival scatter plot
- Survival rate by Pclass and Gender
- Age distributions
- Pie charts for gender survival

## üîß Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation.
 Machine Learning Models Used

This project includes the implementation and evaluation of multiple machine learning classification algorithms to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
‚úÖ Models Implemented:

    Logistic Regression

        Simple and interpretable linear classifier.

        Suitable baseline for binary classification (Survived: 0 or 1).

    Decision Tree Classifier

        Tree-based model that splits features based on Gini impurity or entropy.

        Easy to visualize and explain.

    Random Forest Classifier

        Ensemble of decision trees using bagging.

        More robust and accurate than a single tree.

    Support Vector Machine (SVM)

        Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.

        Works well in high-dimensional space.

    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

        Non-parametric model that classifies based on nearest neighbors in feature space.

üìà Evaluation Metrics:

Each model was evaluated using:

    Accuracy Score

        Measures overall percentage of correct predictions.

    Confusion Matrix

        Provides TP, FP, TN, FN breakdown.

        Helps in visualizing errors (false positives/negatives).

    Cross-Validation

        Used 5-fold or 10-fold cross-validation to ensure model generalizability.

        Prevents overfitting by testing on different splits of the data.

| Model               | Accuracy | CV Score (Avg) |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.81     | 0.79           |
| Decision Tree       | 0.78     | 0.76           |
| Random Forest       | 0.83     | 0.81           |
| SVM                 | 0.80     | 0.78           |
| KNN                 | 0.77     | 0.75           |
